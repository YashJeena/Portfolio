              <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a system that helps optimize the light energy
                absorbed by the solar panels deployed.The method discussed is to continuously or
                discreetly change the angles of the solar panel so that it coordinates with the incident
                light rays from the sun and maintains an angle such that it results in maximum
                absorption of light and as a result maximum energy generation.The project uses linear regression to maximize the amount of sunlight falling on the cells.</p>

              <p>Security assaults on real sites to take clients' data, known as phishing assaults, have been expanding. This sort of assault doesn't simply influence people's or alternately associations' sites. Although a few location techniques for phishing sites have been proposed utilizing AI, profound learning, and different methodologies, their identification exactness should be upgraded. This paper proposes an improved stacking outfit strategy for phishing site discovery. Genetic-algorithm based, a classifier approach was used for improving phishing website detection was presented and explained. Use of SVM, Random Forest and Regression based Algorithms is prominent. We compare the accuracy of these algorithms in this review. .</p>

              <p>The main objective of this project is to create a portable, wireless and short-range communicable 
                zone that can unlock our devices with 1 tap. Even though many researchers have worked on bio 
                metrics security we plant To further enhance it based on the users comfort.
                Nowadays fingerprint sensors are used widely in our daily life varying from something as trivial as 
                mobiles phones to attendance systems. But these things are always integrated into a particular 
                hardware and the user has to always be in contact with it to use it. This is where the uniqueness of 
                our project comes. We will be using the concept of low Bluetooth 4 to unlock devices with the 
                Bluetooth range instead of having the user meet each and every device. The objective of increasing 
                security and usability is to be studied under this project.</p>
